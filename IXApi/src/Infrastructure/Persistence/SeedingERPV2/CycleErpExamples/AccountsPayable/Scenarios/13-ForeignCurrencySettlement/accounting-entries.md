# Accounting and physical effects

## Expected net result

Historical AP 3,750 SAR; bank 3,800 SAR; realized loss 50 SAR; USD balance 0. Aggregate across settlement/payment vouchers.

## Posting specification

Apply [Financial posting effects](../../Documentation/09-FinancialPostingEffects.md) and [Physical effects](../../Documentation/08-PhysicalInventoryEffects.md) for the relevant path. Resolve actual accounts from configuration; do not substitute a hardcoded account to balance a failing voucher.

For every posted step capture accounting date, voucher, account role and actual main account, debit/credit in transaction and accounting currency, source document and any reversing reference. Include intermediate lines and tax/FX/discount effects used by the real implementation. Pending or rejected operations must not create posted financial effects.

Distinguish physical quantity, financial inventory value, vendor net liability and gross open documents. A net-zero vendor balance does not prove settlement. Verify sum of debits equals credits and reconcile all effects to the source input.
